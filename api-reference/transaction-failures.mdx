## Overview

Dodo Payments API provides detailed transaction failure reasons to help you understand why a payment attempt was unsuccessful. These failure reasons are standardized across different payment methods and providers, making it easier to implement consistent error handling in your application.

Each transaction failure response includes:
- A specific failure reason code
- A human-readable error message
- Additional context about the failure when available
- Whether the error is user-correctable or requires system intervention

Understanding these failure reasons is crucial for:
- Providing clear feedback to your customers
- Implementing appropriate retry logic
- Handling different failure scenarios gracefully
- Maintaining a reliable payment processing system

When `false`, the decline is due to system-level issues or bank restrictions that cannot be resolved by the customer.
