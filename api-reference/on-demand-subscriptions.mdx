## **Using On-Demand Subscriptions**

On-demand subscriptions allow you to charge customers flexibly, rather than strictly on a recurring schedule.

## Enabling On-Demand Subscriptions

To enable on-demand subscriptions, contact **Dodo Payments Support**. Once enabled for your business, you'll have access to create and manage on-demand subscriptions.

## Creating an On-Demand Subscription

To create an on-demand subscription, use the [POST /subscriptions](/api-reference/subscriptions/post-subscriptions) API endpoint.

Include the `on_demand` field in your request body to activate on-demand functionality:

```json
"on_demand": {
  "mandate_only": true, // Set to true to authorize payment method without immediate charge
  "product_price": 5000 // Optional: initial product price; defaults to stored product price if omitted
}

```

### Fields Description:

- `mandate_only` (boolean, required):
    - If set to `true`, no immediate charge is performed. Instead, this authorizes the payment method details for future charges.
- `product_price` (integer, optional):
    - Sets the initial price for the product charged to the customer.
    - If not provided, the system defaults to the stored product price.

## Charging an On-Demand Subscription

For subsequent charges on an existing on-demand subscription, use the following endpoint. Try it out in the [API Explorer](/api-reference/misc/charge-subscriptions):

```
POST /subscriptions/{subscription_id}/charge

```

### Parameters

- `subscription_id` (string, path, required): Subscription ID.

### Request Body

```json
{
  "product_price": 7500
}

```

- `product_price` (integer, required): The amount you wish to charge the customer for this transaction.

### Response

A successful charge will return HTTP status `200` with the following response body:

```json
{
  "payment_id": "string"
}

```

This flexibility allows you to manage charges according to your business requirements.
