### New Feature: License Key Management

We are excited to introduce the **License Key Management** feature, designed to help merchants secure their digital products and services by generating, managing, and tracking unique license keys. This feature ensures only authorized users access your products and provides merchants with full control over their license key usage and distribution. Ideal for SaaS businesses and digital product vendors, the tool also includes advanced tracking and revocation capabilities for enhanced security.
