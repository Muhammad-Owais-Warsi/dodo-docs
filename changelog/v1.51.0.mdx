## New Features ðŸš€

### Checkout Sessions API
Introducing our new **Checkout Sessions API** - a powerful, hosted checkout solution that provides a complete payment flow for both one-time purchases and subscriptions. This new API replaces the previous Dynamic Links approach with enhanced flexibility and improved user experience.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Simplified Integration**: No need to provide complete billing addresses upfront - we handle missing details automatically
- **Enhanced Customization**: Full control over payment methods, currencies, themes, and feature flags
- **Better UX**: Pre-fill customer information to reduce checkout friction and improve conversion rates
- **Flexible Configuration**: Support for multi-product carts, subscription trials, discount codes, and more

**What's Changed:**
- **Before**: Required complete billing address information when creating payment links
- **Now**: Pass whatever customer information you have available - we'll collect the rest during checkout
- **Migration**: Simple API endpoint change with no additional handling required
