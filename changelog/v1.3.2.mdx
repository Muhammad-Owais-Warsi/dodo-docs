## New Features ðŸš€

- **Teams Feature**: We have introduced the highly requested Teams Feature. Now, you can invite `Editors` and `Viewers` to your Business and collaborate with them seamlessly. To try it out, navigate to the `Business > Teams` section in the Dashboard.

- **Enhanced Success/Failure Screens**: The default success and failure screens have been updated for cases where no `redirect_url` is provided. These screens now offer greater visibility to your customers and include an option to download the invoice.
