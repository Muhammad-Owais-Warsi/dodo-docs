## New Features ðŸš€

- **Partial Refunds**: We're excited to introduce our new Partial Refunds feature, now available through both our API and Dashboard. This powerful capability allows merchants to process precise refunds for specific components of a payment, whether it's a seat add-on or a portion of a subscription. The feature includes built-in validation to prevent errors and automatically generates refund receipts for your records.
