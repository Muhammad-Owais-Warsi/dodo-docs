- **Subscription Addons**: Introduced support for addons to subscription products. In the Products section, you'll find a new Addons tab where you can create addons such as "Seats".

  - [Get Addon](/api-reference/addons/get-addon)
  - [Update Addon](/api-reference/addons/update-addon)

  With addons, you unlock new billing options such as seat-based billing or variable billing per customer. Get creative with addons to design flexible billing models for your business.
