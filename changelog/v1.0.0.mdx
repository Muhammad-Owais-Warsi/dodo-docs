## New Features ðŸš€

- **Customer Portal**: Introduced the `Customer Portal` feature, allowing customers to manage their subscriptions, invoices, and payment methods. You can create static or dynamic Customer Portal links for your customers via the Dodo Payments Dashboard or through APIs. On the dashboard, navigate to `Sales > Customers > Share Invite`.

- **Customer Portal Session API**: Added the `Customer Portal Session` API to create a session of the Customer Portal for a specific customer. Note that the session is valid for only 24 hours. Check the [API Reference](/api-reference/customers/create-customer-portal-session) for more details.

- **Others**: Minor improvements and bug fixes.
