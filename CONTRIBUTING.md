### Writing Documentation

   - Place files in appropriate directories
   - Follow kebab-case naming: `payment-methods.mdx`

2. **Add Frontmatter**
   ```mdx
   ---
   title: "Your Page Title"
   description: "A brief description of the page content"
   icon: "credit-card"
   ---
   ```

3. **Update Navigation**
   - Edit `docs.json` to include your new page
   - Maintain logical grouping and hierarchy

## üìù Style Guide

### Writing Style
