### **Generate Your Own License Keys with Dodo Payments**

This guide helps merchants generate and validate their own license keys for products they sell. Follow these steps to create and manage license keys effectively while maintaining a smooth user experience.

### **1. Understanding License Keys**

* **What is a License Key?**

  * A license key is a unique code provided to customers after purchase, granting access to a product or service.

* **Why Use License Keys?**

  * Ensure only paying customers access your products.

  * Manage product usage (e.g., limit activations, track licenses).

  * Protect digital content from unauthorized distribution

### **2. Generating License Keys**

With **Dodo Payments**, merchants are instantly notified when a transaction is successful, either via email or webhook. This notification serves as the trigger to generate license keys.

### **Step-by-Step Guide to Generating Keys**

1. **Choose a License Key Format:**

   * Example formats:

     * Alphanumeric: `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` (e.g., `ABCD-EFGH-IJKL-MNOP`)

     * UUID: `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`

   * Ensure keys are unique and hard to guess.

2. **Use a License Key Generation Library/Tool:**

   * **Programming Languages:**

     * **Python**: Use the `uuid` library.
       import uuid
       license\_key = str(uuid.uuid4())
       print("License Key:", license\_key)


     * **JavaScript**: Use the `crypto` module for secure random strings.
       const \{ randomUUID } = require('crypto');
       const licenseKey = randomUUID();
       console.log("License Key:", licenseKey);


   * **Online Tools:**

     * Use tools like [RandomKeygen](https://randomkeygen.com/) to generate secure keys

3. **Trigger Key Generation via Dodo Payments Notifications:**

   * Once **Dodo Payments** confirms a successful transaction via email or webhook, generate the license key programmatically.

   * **Example Workflow:**

     * Dodo Payments sends a webhook notification with transaction details.

     * Your system receives the notification, validates the transaction, and generates the license key

4. **Store Keys Securely:**

   * Save generated keys in a database with the following fields:

     * Customer Name/Email.

     * Product Name.

     * Product Quantity.

     * Purchase Date.

     * License Key.

     * Expiry Date (if applicable).

### **3. Delivering License Keys**

You can use the following methods to deliver license keys to your customer:

### **Delivery Options:**

1. **Email:**

   * Automatically email the license key to the customer after payment confirmation via Dodo Payments.

2. **Download Page:**

   * After payment, redirect the customer to a confirmation page displaying their license key.

3. **Customer Account:**

   * Include a section in your customer dashboard where users can view their purchased keys.

### **4. Validating License Keys**

To ensure proper use, implement a validation mechanism for your license keys.

### **Step-by-Step Guide to Validate Keys**

1. **Store Keys in a Database:**

   * Maintain a list of valid keys along with their associated product and customer details.

2. **Use Validation Logic:**

   * **Server-Side Validation:**

     * When the customer enters a license key, validate it against your database.

### **5. Managing License Keys**

1. **Track Activations:**

   * Limit the number of devices that can activate a key.

   * Example: Store the device's unique identifier (e.g., MAC address, IMEI) alongside the license key in your database.

2. **Revoke Keys:**

   * Use Dodo Payments' transaction logs to identify refunds or disputes and revoke the associated keys.

3. **Renewals (For Subscriptions):**

   * Automatically generate a new key or extend the validity of an existing key when the subscription renews.

4. **Expiration:**

   * If the license is time-limited, ensure the key expires after the set duration.

### **6. Customer Communication**

1. **Key Usage Instructions:**

   * Provide clear instructions on how to use the license key.

   * Example: “Enter your license key on the activation page of \[Product Name].”

2. **Support:**

   * Include a help section or contact email for customers facing issues with their keys.

### **7. Role of Dodo Payments**

1. **Real-Time Transaction Notifications:**

   * Dodo Payments notifies merchants instantly of successful transactions via:

     * **Webhooks**: Automated notifications containing transaction details.

     * **Emails**: Immediate confirmation of payments.

   * Use these notifications as triggers to generate license keys.

2. **Comprehensive Reporting:**

   * Dodo Payments provides detailed transaction logs, helping merchants reconcile license key activations with completed payments

### **8. Best Practices**

* Use **encryption** to secure your license key database.

* Regularly audit your license management system for anomalies.

* Monitor webhook logs via the **Dodo Payments Dashboard** to ensure no transaction is missed.

By integrating **Dodo Payments** notifications with your license key system, you can automate key generation, validation, and delivery for a seamless customer experience
