## Introduction

At Dodo Payments, we act as a Merchant of Record (MoR), managing payment processing, invoicing, taxes, refunds, and disputes on behalf of the businesses that use our platform. To safeguard customers, businesses, and partners, we operate a structured monitoring program. This program ensures that accounts on our platform remain compliant with card network rules, applicable laws, and our [Merchant Acceptance Policy].

## Purpose

Our monitoring framework is designed to protect both businesses and customers. By identifying and addressing potential risks early, we help ensure a trusted and reliable payment environment.

## Monitoring Approach

We combine automated checks with human review to maintain oversight of business activity. Reviews focus on:

1. Compliance with our [Merchant Acceptance Policy](/miscellaneous/merchant-acceptance)
2. Consistency between what is disclosed at onboarding and what is offered live
3. Compliance with card network rules, sanctions, and applicable laws
4. Customer experience signals such as refunds and disputes
5. Use of approved brands, domains, and product lines

## When Reviews Occur

Reviews take place at key points in the lifecycle:

1. **Activation & First Transaction** – to confirm that products and checkout experiences match what was disclosed.
2. **Before First Payout** – to complete compliance checks and validate fulfillment.
3. **Ongoing Triggers** – when significant changes occur, such as new domains, product shifts, unusual transaction patterns, or rising disputes / refunds.
4. **Periodic Reviews** – regular monitoring to help ensure continued compliance.

## Outcomes of Reviews

Following a review, possible outcomes include:

1. **Continued support** – your account remains active on the platform.
2. **Remediation** – we may ask you to correct issues or provide clarifications.
3. **Deboarding** – in cases of prohibited activity, policy violations, or non-response, the account may be closed and payouts withheld in line with our enforcement process.

## Customer Protection

We take customer complaints, fraud alerts, and refund requests seriously. In such cases, we may contact both the customer and your business. If we don’t receive a response within reasonable timelines, refunds may be processed automatically and your account may be restricted or closed.

## Transparency & Communication

If clarifications are required, we contact you at your registered email address. You’ll have the opportunity to respond and provide context. Where no response is received, accounts may be closed and funds held in line with card network and regulatory requirements.

## Enforcement

Violations of our policies, card network rules, or applicable laws may result in:

1. Suspension of payments
2. Account closure
3. Notifications to card networks, partners, or regulators as required

## Commitment to Fairness

Our monitoring standards are applied consistently across all businesses. We aim to work collaboratively to resolve issues where possible, while maintaining strong protections for customers and the payment ecosystem.
