  <Accordion title="Step 2 : Identity Verification and Business Verification">
    **Overview**

    The **Identity Verification** and **Business Verification** processes are critical steps for ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory standards. These verifications confirm the identity of the merchant and the legitimacy of their business. Merchants must complete both steps to unlock full access to the Dodo Payments platform, including payment processing and payouts.

    * **Identity Verification**: Verifies the individual managing the merchant account by requiring personal identification documents.

    * **Business Verification**: Confirms the legitimacy of the business entity, requiring submission of business registration and related documents.

    **Key Highlights**

    1. **Secure Document Submission**
       Merchants can securely submit personal and business documents, which are reviewed manually for compliance.

    2. **Multiple Businesses**
       Merchants can add and verify multiple businesses under a single account, allowing seamless switching between verified businesses.
