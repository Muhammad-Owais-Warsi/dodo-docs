## Billing on the basis of number of API calls

In this section you'll see how the business can charge on the basis of the number of API calls made by their customers.

### Creating a Meter

</Frame>

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure Basic Information">
Set up the fundamental details for your meter.

<ParamField path="Meter Name" type="string" required>
Choose a clear, descriptive name that identifies what this meter tracks.

Examples: "Tokens", "API Calls", "Storage Usage", "Compute Hours"
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Description" type="string">
Provide a detailed explanation of what this meter measures.

Example: "Counts each POST /v1/orders request made by the customer"
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Event Name" type="string" required>
Specify the event identifier that will trigger this meter.

Examples: "token", "api.call", "storage.usage", "compute.session"
</ParamField>

<Info>
The event name must match exactly what you send in your usage events. Event names are case-sensitive.
</Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Aggregation Settings">
Define how the meter calculates usage from your events.

<ParamField path="Aggregation Type" type="string" required>
Select how events should be aggregated:
To calculate the number of API calls go wtih `Count` type.

</ParamField>


<ParamField path="Measurement Unit" type="string" required>
Define the unit label for display purposes in reports and billing.

Examples: "calls", "GB", "hours", "tokens"
</ParamField>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Event Filtering (Optional)">
Set up criteria to control which events are included in the meter.


**Enable Event Filtering**

Toggle **Enable Event Filtering** to activate conditional event processing.

**Choose Filter Logic**

Select how multiple conditions are evaluated:

<Note>
    Filters in the image means any event with status code of `200` at `/v1/api` by the customer with `premium` plan under `14th` hour will be counted and else ignored.
</Note>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="AND Logic">
All conditions must be true for an event to be counted. Use this when you need events to meet multiple strict criteria simultaneously.

**Example:** Count API calls where `user_tier = "premium"` AND `endpoint = "/api/v2/users"`
</Tab>

<Tab title="OR Logic">
At least one condition must be true for an event to be counted. Use this when you want to include events that meet any of several criteria.

**Example:** Count events where `method = "POST"` OR `method = "PUT"` OR `method = "DELETE"`
</Tab>
</Tabs>

**Setting Up Filter Conditions**

<Steps>
<Step title="Add Condition">
Click **Add condition** to create a new filter rule.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Property Key">
Specify the property name from your event metadata.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Comparator">
Choose from available operators:
- `equals` - Exact match
- `not equals` - Exclusion filter
- `greater than` - Numeric comparison  
- `greater than or equals` - Numeric comparison (inclusive)
- `less than` - Numeric comparison
- `less than or equals` - Numeric comparison (inclusive)
- `contains` - String contains substring
- `does not contain` - String exclusion filter
</Step>

<Step title="Set Comparison Value">
Set the target value for comparison.
</Step>

<Step title="Add Groups">
Use **Add Group** to create additional condition groups for complex logic.
</Step>
</Steps>


<Warning>
Filtered properties must be included in your event metadata for the conditions to work properly. Events missing required properties will be excluded from counting.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Create Meter">
Review your meter configuration and click on **Create Meter**.

<Check>
Your meter is now ready to receive and aggregate usage events.
</Check>

</Step>
</Steps>


## Billing on the basis of Token Usage

In this section you'll see how the business can charge on the basis of Token usage by their customers.
