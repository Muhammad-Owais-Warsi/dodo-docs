## What is an Add-On?

An **Add-On** is an optional, paid enhancement that can be bundled with a subscription. It allows you to offer additional value to your customers on top of their primary subscription. Add-Ons follow the same billing cycle as the associated subscription and cannot be purchased independently.

For example, if you're offering a SaaS product subscription, Add-Ons can include extras like:

- Additional Credits
- Additional User Seats
- Extra Storage Space
- Feature Packs

<Info>
Add-Ons are billed in sync with the main subscription (monthly, yearly, etc.). Customers can select a quantity of each Add-On during checkout.

## Merchant Workflow

### Step 1: Create an Add-On

To create an Add-On:

1. Navigate to the **Products** section in your dashboard.
2. Click on **Create Add-On**.

    </Frame>
    
3. Fill in the following details:

    <img src="/images/addons/2.png" alt="Create Add-On Form" />
</Frame>

- **Name**: A short, descriptive name for the Add-On (e.g., "5 Extra Seats").
- **Description**: Explain what the Add-On offers.
- **Price & Currency**: Set the recurring price and select the applicable currency.
- **Tax Category**: Assign a tax category for accurate tax calculation.
- **Image**: (Optional) Upload a relevant image or icon for the Add-On.
4. Click **Create** to save the Add-On.

<Tip>
Create Add-Ons that align with common customer needs or upgrade paths.

### Step 2: Associate Add-Ons with a Subscription

Each subscription plan can be associated with up to **3 Add-Ons**. To do this:

1. While creating or editing a subscription plan, scroll to the **Add-Ons** section.
2. Select up to three relevant Add-Ons from the list.
3. Save your changes.

These Add-Ons will now appear as optional purchases when a customer selects this subscription.

### Step 3: Customer Checkout Experience

When a customer selects a subscription plan:

- The associated Add-Ons will be displayed on the **Checkout Page**.
- Customers can choose the quantity (if applicable) for each Add-On.
- The total subscription cost will update accordingly.

All selected Add-Ons will be billed **together** with the base subscription at the defined frequency.

**The Add-Ons will be reflected in the invoice as well**

## Important Notes

- Add-Ons **cannot exist independently** – they must be tied to a subscription.
- The **payment frequency** of an Add-On will always match the subscription (e.g., monthly or annually).
- Add-Ons can only be created and managed from the **Products** section → Add-ons tab in your dashboard.
