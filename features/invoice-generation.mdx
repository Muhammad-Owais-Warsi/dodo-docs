## How It Works

The **Invoice Generation** feature is designed to automate the entire invoicing process, allowing merchants to focus on their business instead of handling paperwork. Every time a transaction is completed, whether it’s for a one-time purchase or a subscription renewal, an invoice is automatically created and sent to the customer. Merchants can customize these invoices in advance, ensuring they align with their brand and provide all necessary details.

Invoices can be accessed through the dashboard, where merchants can download, resend, or manage them as needed.

### Merchant Configures Invoice Settings

Before the invoice generation system can be used, merchants must configure their invoice settings. This allows merchants to ensure that all invoices reflect their business’s branding and comply with any necessary tax regulations.

#### Configuration Options:

- **Branding**: Upload your company logo and adjust colors to match your brand identity. This ensures that your invoices have a professional appearance.

#### How to Configure:

1. Go to the **Settings** section of the Dodo Payments dashboard and open **Business Profile Tab**.
2. Upload your business logo and add your business name to be displayed on the invoice.
3. Save the settings, and your invoices will automatically use these customizations moving forward.

### Transaction is Processed

Once a customer completes a purchase —whether it’s for a one-time product or a recurring subscription—the Dodo Payments system automatically prepares to generate an invoice.

#### Triggers for Invoice Generation:

- **One-Time Purchases**: Any single purchase of a product or service.
- **Subscription Payments**: Recurring payments, such as monthly or yearly subscription renewals.

## Invoice is Automatically Generated

Once the payment is successfully processed, the Dodo Payments system automatically generates an invoice.

## Merchant Accesses and Manages Invoices

Merchants can view, manage, and resend invoices from the **Invoices** section in the Dodo Payments dashboard. This section provides a comprehensive view of all generated invoices, allowing merchants to easily track payments.

### Features of the Invoices Section:

- **View Invoices**: See a list of all generated invoices, each marked with its payment status (e.g., paid, pending, refunded).
- **Download Invoices**: Export individual invoices as PDF files for internal records or customer requests.
- **Filter Invoices**: Use filters to search for invoices by date, customer name, or status for quicker access to specific invoices.
