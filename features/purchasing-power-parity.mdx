## Introduction

[ParityDeals](https://www.paritydeals.com/) is a platform that enables automatic pricing optimization based on a customer's geographical location, commonly known as "purchasing power parity" pricing.

With ParityDeals, you can also offer [automatic time-based discounts](https://www.paritydeals.com/features/time-based-discounts/) and [holiday-based promotions](https://www.paritydeals.com/features/holiday-based-discounts/) throughout the year.

<Info>
While you can't directly embed the ParityDeals banner on a Dodo Payments storefront (as custom scripts aren't supported), you can still implement ParityDeals effectively on your own website or application.

## How It Works

When ParityDeals is integrated into your website, eligible visitors will see a banner that includes a location-based discount code they can use at checkout.

These discount codes are automatically created and managed by ParityDeals and will appear in your **Dodo Payments Dashboard** under **Sales → Discounts**.

### 8. Customize the Banner

Design your discount banner by:

### 9. Add the ParityDeals Script to Your Website

After saving your deal, ParityDeals will generate a script. Add this script to your website code (typically in the `<head>` section).

This script automatically detects visitor locations and displays the appropriate discount banner.
