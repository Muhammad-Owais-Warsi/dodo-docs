## Customer Experience

## Important Considerations

- **Security**: Static download links are not order-authenticated. Customers with the link can re-share the same link with other parties. For secure or licensed content, consider integrating with external services that support gated or authenticated access.
- **File Updates**: Updating a file or external link will affect all future purchases only. Past purchases will not be affected and customers can still access those files
- **Refunds**: Issuing a refund does not revoke access to files. Customers who already downloaded a file will still have it on their device.
- **Best Practice**: For version control or limited-time access, consider delivering your content via expiring or signed URLs hosted externally.
