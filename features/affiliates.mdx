## Integration Steps

We have partnered with Affonso, a leading affiliate management platform to power your sales. Follow the steps below to connect your Dodo Payments account with Affonso and begin tracking affiliate-driven sales.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect with Dodo Payments">
    To get started, connect your Dodo Payments account by adding your API key.

    ### How to Get Your Dodo Payments API Key

    - Log in to your **Dodo Payments Dashboard**
    - Go to the **Developer** section in the left menu
    - Click on **API Keys**
    - Select **Add API Key**
    - Give it a name (e.g. "Affonso Integration")
    - Click **Create** and **copy** your API key

    ### Add Your API Key to Affonso

    - Open your **Affonso Dashboard via** [affonso.io](https://affonso.io/)
    - Go to **Program Details > Connect**
    - Click the **Dodo Payments integration** card
    - Paste your Dodo Payments API key
    - Click **Connect**

    <Callout type="info">
      Your API key will be securely encrypted by Affonso.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Webhook to Dodo Payments">
    Once connected, you'll receive a unique webhook URL from Affonso. This enables payment tracking and affiliate commission triggering.

    ### Add Webhook URL in Dodo Payments

    - In your Dodo Payments Dashboard, go to **Developer → Webhooks**
    - Click **Add Webhook**
    - Paste your **Affonso webhook URL** (from your program settings)
    - Save the webhook

    ### Add Webhook Secret in Affonso

    - After saving the webhook in Dodo Payments, **copy the signing key** provided
    - Paste it back into Affonso under the **Dodo Payments webhook settings**

    <Callout type="info">
      This allows Affonso to securely verify incoming events from Dodo Payments.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the Tracking Script">
    Place the Affonso pixel on your site to start tracking affiliate visits and conversions.

    ```html
    <!-- Place in <head> tag -->
    <script async defer
    src="https://affonso.io/js/pixel.min.js"
    data-affonso="YOUR_PUBLIC_PROGRAM_ID"
    data-cookie_duration="YOUR_COOKIE_DURATION">
    </script>
    ```

    This script:
    - Tracks affiliate visits
    - Sets a cookie with the referral ID (`affonso_referral`)
    - Enables signup and payment tracking

    <Callout type="info">
      Place this on all domains where users visit or convert (e.g. marketing site, app).
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track User Signups">
    To gain funnel visibility and optimize affiliate performance, track user signups as leads.

    ```js
    // After successful registration
    window.Affonso.signup(userEmail);
    ```

    This will:
    - Log a new referral as a **LEAD** if the user came via an affiliate link
    - Display it in your dashboard and the affiliate's stats

    <Callout type="info">
      Best practice: Trigger this after successful registration or double opt-in (DOI).
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pass Referral Data to Dodo Payments">
    To attribute commissions correctly, pass the referral ID from Affonso to Dodo Payments during checkout.

    ### Payments Integration

    ```js
    import DodoPayments from 'dodopayments';

    const referralId = window.affonso_referral;

    });

    async function main() {
      const payment = await client.payments.create({

        customer: { email: 'email@email.com', name: 'name' },
        product_cart: [{ product_id: 'product_id', quantity: 0 }],
        metadata: {
          affonso_referral: referralId,
        },
      });

      console.log(payment.payment_id);
    }

    main();

        quantity: 1,
        metadata: {
          affonso_referral: referralId,
        },
      });

      console.log(subscription.subscription_id);
    }

    main();
    ```

    const originalLink = 'https://checkout.dodopayments.com/buy/<YOUR_PRODUCT_ID>';

    ```
