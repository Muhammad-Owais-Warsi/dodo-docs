title: MoR vs PG
description: "When it comes to processing payments globally, digital businesses and SaaS companies are often torn between two models: Merchant of Record (MoR) and Payment Gateway (PG). At Dodo Payments, we believe in simplifying global payments while taking care of compliance, taxes, and local laws — and that's why we operate as a Merchant of Record."

## 🏗️ Introduction
 This guide compares the MoR model with the traditional Payment Gateway approach, helping you understand the advantages Dodo Payments brings to your business.

## 🌍 The Core Difference

| Feature                          | MoR (Dodo Payments)         | Payment Gateway (Traditional PG)           |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Legal Seller                     | Dodo Payments (MoR)                        | Your Company                               |
| Tax Collection & Remittance     | Handled by Dodo                            | You are responsible                        |
| Compliance & Regulatory Burden  | Dodo assumes liability                     | You handle local laws and chargebacks      |
| Settlement Currency             | USD, EUR, INR, and 25+ others supported    | Depends on your merchant account           |
| Risk Management                 | Built-in fraud and chargeback protection   | You set up your own tools (e.g. Stripe Radar) |
| Payouts                         | Aggregated and simplified global payouts   | Direct from PG to you, with bank setup     |

## 📊 Visual Comparison

**Revenue Flow: Payment Gateway**
```
Customer → Your Website → PG (e.g. Stripe) → Your Bank
        → You handle tax, support, refunds, fraud
```

**Revenue Flow: Merchant of Record (Dodo)**
```
Customer → Dodo Checkout → Dodo Payments → Your Wallet
        → Dodo handles tax, compliance, FX, fraud, invoicing
```

## 🔍 Why It Matters for SaaS & Digital Businesses

As your business scales, managing taxes, compliance, and global payment preferences can become overwhelming. With a payment gateway, you're responsible for:

- VAT/GST registration and filing in multiple jurisdictions
- Managing currency conversion and chargebacks
- Providing localized checkout and payment methods

With Dodo Payments as your MoR:
- You expand globally without setting up local entities
- Taxes are calculated, collected, and remitted on your behalf
- You gain access to a library of payment methods tailored to your customers
- We act as your legal buffer and operational partner

> “Think of a payment gateway as a tunnel. Now imagine the Merchant of Record as a tunnel, train, driver, and ticketing staff all-in-one.”



## 🚀 Who Should Use MoR?
Dodo Payments is perfect for:
- SaaS & digital product companies
- Indie creators and solopreneurs
- Global businesses with customers across 100+ countries
- Companies who don’t want to manage taxes & compliance in-house

If you're expanding internationally, selling subscriptions, or just want to reduce operational headaches, MoR is the smarter choice.

## ⚖️ When to Use a Payment Gateway Instead

There are cases where using just a payment gateway might make sense:
- Your business operates only in one country
- You already have internal finance and compliance resources
- You require complete control over customer billing experience
- You are highly cost-sensitive with thin margins at scale

For many startups, using a gateway may suffice initially — but as complexity grows, switching to an MoR can save time, reduce risk, and accelerate international growth.
