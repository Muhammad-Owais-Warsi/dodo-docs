## Introduction

Multi-Brand lets you attach several brands—each with its own logo, descriptor, and website URL—to **one verified business**. Your payout account, fees, and KYC stay exactly the same, while every Product, Payment Link, Subscription, Invoice, and Transaction can now be filed under a specific brand. Use it to test new niches, localise a site, or separate B2B and B2C lines without opening extra business accounts.

## Merchant Dashboard Flow

1. **Open Business Settings → Brands.** The Brands page lists your Primary brand and any Secondary brands.
2. **Click “Add Brand” →** A Brand Verification form opens up.

4. Upload Logo, set Statement Descriptor, and Support Email for each brand
5. **Approval.** Once our compliance team marks the website “Verified”, live mode will be enabled for this brand. Products can now be tagged to this brand and live payment links will display its branding.
6. **Brand selector.** A Brand filter is now visible on Product creation.

7. Transactions and Subscriptions have a Brand ID to help you identify which brand the transaction belongs to.

## Additional Points

- **No payout changes:** All funds, payout cycles and fees still flow to the business-level wallet and merchant bank account.
- **Suspensions:** If a brand is suspended, only its payment links stop—other brands under the same business keep transacting.
- No changes to Storefront, Invoices, License Keys, Discount Codes, Payout Settings and any other business level features.
